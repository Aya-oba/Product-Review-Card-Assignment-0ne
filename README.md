## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot
(Product Review Card Desktop.jpeg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I think my focus will be more on the css...

```css
div{
    display: block;
    margin: auto;
    position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

I want and will always continue focus on in future projects. In as much as it will help me become better than I am now.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This app helped me alot when I lost my balance while working... Even though my work isnt still perfect I can say i tried my best.
